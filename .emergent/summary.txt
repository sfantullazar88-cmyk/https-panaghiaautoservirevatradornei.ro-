<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user initially requested a clone of . However, this site was inaccessible. The user then clarified that their actual goal was to recover and continue working on a previous project named food-delivery-app-160. After explaining that old session work is lost if not saved to GitHub, the user provided a preview link to the old project (). The task then became to create a pixel-perfect clone of that preview link.

Recently, the user expressed frustration about the lost project and their Pro subscription, asking for a refund. They have been directed to the support team for this issue.

**User's preferred language**: Romanian. The next agent MUST respond in Romanian.

**what currently exists?**: A complete frontend-only clone of the user's Panaghia - Autoservire Vatra Dornei application has been built. It uses React and TailwindCSS. The application is multi-page, including Home, Menu, Team, Contact, and Order pages. All data is currently mocked and stored in . The UI and styling, including fonts, have been implemented to match the user's previous project.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent finished recreating the frontend of the Panaghia food delivery app. The last interaction was addressing the user's frustration regarding their Pro subscription and inability to edit the old project. The agent correctly explained that the old preview link is static and redirected the user to the support team for billing inquiries.
- Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- Agent Testing Done: Y (via screenshots)
- Which testing method agent to use?: manual testing by user. The user needs to visually inspect the recreated frontend and confirm if it meets their expectations before any further development.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: (Priority: P0) User is frustrated about their paid subscription and the loss of their previous project. They have requested a refund and threatened a chargeback.
  - Attempted fixes: The agent has explained that it cannot handle billing issues and has directed the user to the official support channels (email and Discord).
  - Next debug checklist: The next agent must be prepared for the user to bring this up again. The agent should gently acknowledge the user's frustration, reiterate that the support team will handle the billing query, and try to pivot the conversation back to the development of the newly created project. The primary goal is to get the user's feedback on the recreated frontend.
  - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Addressing the user's emotional state is critical to unblock the project. Until the user feels heard and agrees to move forward, no technical progress can be made.
  - Status: BLOCKED (on user's emotional state and support team's response)
  - Is recurring issue?: N
  - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: N/A
  - Blocked on other issue: N/A

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress. The frontend recreation is complete pending user review.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **Task 1 (P0)**: Get user confirmation that the recreated frontend clone is satisfactory. Ask explicitly: Sunteți mulțumit de site-ul pe care l-am recreat?

    - **Task 2 (P1)**: If the user requests changes, implement the frontend modifications.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **Task 3 (P2)**: Create a  file to plan the backend development. This should include API endpoints and database schema for menu items, orders, etc.
    - **Task 4 (P3)**: Implement the FastAPI backend, including MongoDB models and CRUD API endpoints for managing the menu and processing orders.
    - **Task 5 (P4)**: Integrate the React frontend with the new backend API, replacing the mocked data in  with live data.
